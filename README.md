Alexander Afzelius Puccini, Paulo Vila Nova, Ellinor Nilsson Kaufeldt

How we divided the work:
Header, Contact form, Footer - Paulo
About us, The Team - Alexander
Recent projects, Reviews - Ellinor

Some parts that overlapped eachother we split between us. And if someone couldn't solve a part someone else jumped in and helped if they could.

We worked from mobile first and used graceful degregation.

We had regular meetings to discuss what we had done and if the rest of the group liked it or wanted to change something. And before we left the meeting we talked about what needed to be done until next time.
We also communicated via Slack and used Trello to keep track of our progress.
